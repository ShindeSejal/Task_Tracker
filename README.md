Mark a task as in progress or done
List all tasks
List all tasks that are done
List all tasks that are not done
List all tasks that are in progress
Here are some constraints to guide the implementation:

You can use any programming language to build this project.
Use positional arguments in command line to accept user inputs.
Use a JSON file to store the tasks in the current directory.
The JSON file should be created if it does not exist.
Use the native file system module of your programming language to interact with the JSON file.

Ensure to handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
